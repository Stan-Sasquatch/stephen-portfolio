            I'm a 27 year old, originally from Wokingham, with a degree in Mathematics from the University of Sheffield.
            <br />
            In my spare time I tend to be running, climbing, coding or playing in my band!
<br />
            <br />
            My background has led me towards the financial sector, where I currently work, but I have always gravitated to the technical/system side of the companies i've worked in.
            <br /> <br /> Coding has been a hobby for me up until recently but I now feel i'm ready to transistion into a career in web development.
